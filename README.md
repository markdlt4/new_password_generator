# new_password_generator
I create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. You will find a clean and polished user interface that is responsive. The app will adapt to multiple screen sizes.
About:
Use this app to generate unique passwords between 8 and 128 characters that can include upper case letters; lower case letters; special characters; and numbers.
